# MemeSpot
Nowadays, MemeCreators are on fire on social media. But neither do they have any special platform to showcase their creations without any restrictions nor do they have any monetary support mechanisms. So, I have come up with a solution, named MemeSpot, where MemeCreators can freely share their creations without any restrictions and if the user likes their work they do donate some amount as a 'super thanks' in order to support the creator and motivate him/her to keep creating such content. 

So, Here is the Figma link of the project:-
